description = "(15 Jan 2022) Afghanistan's new Taliban rulers say they hope to be able to open all schools for girls across the country after late March, their spokesman told The Associated Press on Saturday, offering the first timeline for addressing a key demand of the international community.\nSince the Taliban takeover in mid-August, girls in most of Afghanistan have not been allowed back to school beyond grade 7. \nThe international community, reluctant to formally recognize a Taliban-run administration, is wary they could impose similar harsh measures as during their previous rule 20 years ago. At the time, women were banned from education, work and public life.\nZabihullah Mujahid, who is also the Taliban's deputy minister of culture and information, said their education departments are looking to open classrooms for all girls and women following the Afghan New Year, which starts on March 21. Afghanistan, like neighboring Iran, observers the Islamic solar Hijri Shamsi calendar.\nEducation for girls and women "is a question of capacity," Mujahid said in the interview.\nGirls and boys must be completely segregated in schools, he said, adding that the biggest obstacle so far has been finding or building enough dorms, or hostels, where girls could stay while going to school. \nIn heavily populated areas, it is not enough to have separate classrooms for boys and girls — separate school buildings are needed, he said.\n"We are not against education," Mujahid stressed, speaking at a Kabul office building with marble floors that once housed Afghan attorney general's offices and which the Taliban have adopted for their culture and information ministry.\nThe Taliban dictates so far have been erratic, varying from province to province. Girls have not been allowed back to classrooms in state-run schools beyond grade 7, except in about 10 of the country's 34 provinces. \nIn the capital, Kabul, private universities and high schools have continued to operate uninterrupted. Most are small and the classes have always been segregated.\n"We are trying to solves these problems by the coming year," so that schools and universities can open, Mujahid said.\nThe international community has been skeptical of Taliban announcements, saying it will judge them by their actions — even as it scrambles to provide billions of dollars to avert a humanitarian catastrophe that the U.N. chief this week warned could endanger the lives of millions.\nWith a breakdown of services and only sporadic electricity in the bitterly cold Afghan winters, most people rely on firewood and coal for heat. Among the hardest hit are some 3 million Afghans who live as refugees within their own country, having fled their homes because of war, drought, poverty or fear of the Taliban.\nEarlier this month, the United Nations launched a $5 billion appeal for Afghanistan, the single largest appeal for one country.\nWashington has spent $145 billion on reconstruction and development projects in Afghanistan since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion that ousted the Taliban regime. Yet even before the Taliban recaptured the country, the poverty rate was 54% —and a 2018 Gallup poll revealed unprecedented misery among Afghans.\nMujahid appealed for economic cooperation, trade and "stronger diplomatic relations." \nThe international community has called for a more representative government that includes women as well as ethnic and religious minorities. \n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/cc725aadf4e24f1385ccffad55de3eba"
